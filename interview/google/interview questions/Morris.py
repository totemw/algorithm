"""
Find sum of the leaf nodes of the binary tree,
provided there are billions of nodes in the tree.
Expected O(1) space solution (you can't use recursion as it will throw stack overflow exception).

You an also do some modifications in your tree.
Use a stack to traverse the tree.

2. Morris traversal

1. Initialize current as root
2. While current is not NULL
   If the current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as the right child of the rightmost
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
