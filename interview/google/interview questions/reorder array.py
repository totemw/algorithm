Given 3 int arrays a, b and c.
Array a is sorted and contains elements [1..n] (no duplicates).
Array b is a permutation of the array a.
Reorder array c into array d according to the same permutation rule.

Example:

Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b = [4, 1, 2, 5, 3], c = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [9, 6, 7, 10, 8]

hash map of plus or minus
