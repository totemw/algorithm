"""
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
A subsequence of a string is a new string
which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
